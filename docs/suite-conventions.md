# stepwise suite conventions

Shared UX and integration conventions for **rgx**, **agx**, and **sift**
— the three tools that make up the **stepwise** suite. Maintained by
maintainer discipline, not CI. Review every new feature against this
document before merge.

The user-facing landing page for the suite lives at
[`brevity1swos/stepwise`](https://github.com/brevity1swos/stepwise) (not
yet public); brevity1swos is the GitHub organization, stepwise is the
suite's product name.

**Purpose.** Make the three tools feel coordinated without coupling their
codebases. A user who learns one tool should recognize roughly 80% of
the next one's keys, flags, colors, and CLI surface area. The sharing
happens at the convention level, not the code level — no shared crate,
no shared config directory, no shared release train.

## 1. Keybindings (TUI)

Every TUI-bearing tool uses the same key for the same verb.

| Key | Verb | rgx | agx | sift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `j` / `↓` | next item | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `k` / `↑` | prev item | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `g` / `Home` | first item | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `G` / `End` | last item | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `d` / `PgDn` | jump forward | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `u` / `PgUp` | jump back | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `q` / `Esc` | quit / dismiss overlay | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `?` / `F1` | help overlay | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/` | search / filter | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `n` / `N` | next / prev search match | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `y` | yank to clipboard | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `:N` | jump to item N | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `m<c>` / `'<c>` | set / goto bookmark | — | ✓ | — |
| `a` | annotate current item | — | ✓ | (retrofit, see §10) |
| `h` | heatmap toggle | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `s` | stats overlay | — | ✓ | — |
| `Tab` | cycle panel / 2-pane fallback | ✓ | ✓ | — |

### Tool-specific keys

Single-letter keys owned by one tool and not used cross-tool:

- **rgx:** `Ctrl+D` debugger, `Ctrl+G` codegen, `Ctrl+X` grex overlay,
  `Ctrl+W` whitespace, `Ctrl+S` save workspace, `F2` recipes,
  `Alt+↑/↓` pattern history, `Ctrl+←/→` word movement
- **agx:** `f` filter, `A` annotation list, `b` branch tree (planned)
- **sift:** `Enter` accept, `r` revert, `e` edit post-state in `$EDITOR`,
  `t` → agx timeline jump, `p` → rgx policy debug (planned)

### Cross-tool (named integration) keys

Keys that shell out to a sibling tool. Feature-detected; silently degrade
when the sibling is missing (status-bar hint, not a hard failure).

| Key | From | To | Named flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t` | sift review | `agx --jump-to <session>:<step>` | Timeline jump |
| `p` | sift review (planned) | `rgx --pattern <policy-rule>` | Policy debug |
| `R` | agx (proposed, Phase 5+) | `rgx --pattern <regex-arg>` | Regex lens |

---

## 2. CLI grammar

Same flag, same semantics, across tools that support the concept.

| Flag | Meaning | rgx | agx | sift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--summary` | non-interactive summary → stdout | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `--export md\|html\|json` | transcript / ledger export | — | ✓ | planned |
| `--debug-unknowns` | format-drift report → stderr | — | ✓ | planned |
| `--bench` | timing info → stderr (hidden) | — | ✓ | — |
| `--no-cost` | suppress cost estimates | — | ✓ | n/a |
| `--completions <shell>` | shell completion script | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `--version` | print version + exit | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `--help` / `-h` | print help + exit | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Subcommand grammar

- `<tool> doctor` — health check, reports siblings detected on `PATH` plus
  their versions. Shipped in sift (planned); retrofit to agx and rgx.
- `<tool> corpus <dir>` — batch analysis over a directory tree. Shipped
  in agx; planned in sift; n/a for rgx.
- `<tool> init` — wire up integration with a host tool (hooks, configs).
  Shipped in sift; n/a for rgx and agx.

### Exit codes

- `0` — success, nothing unusual
- `1` — expected no-result path (no matches, no pending, validation failure)
- `2` — error (bad args, missing file, parse failure, missing required sibling)

---

## 3. Color palette

The conversation palette is shared across agx and sift. rgx's regex-
semantic palette is scoped to regex tokens and doesn't conflict.

| Token | Color | rgx | agx | sift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[user]` / user input | cyan | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `[asst]` / assistant text | green | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `[tool]` / tool call | yellow | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `[result]` / tool result | magenta | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| error / `is_error` | red + bold | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| annotation marker | magenta `*` prefix | — | ✓ | planned |
| batch / fork marker | gray `║` prefix | — | ✓ | — |
| accepted ledger entry | green | — | — | ✓ |
| reverted ledger entry | red | — | — | ✓ |
| pending ledger entry | default | — | — | ✓ |

### rgx regex palette (scoped, no cross-tool meaning)

- matches: cycling background colors (alternating for adjacent matches)
- capture groups: per-group foreground colors
- anchors / quantifiers / character classes: distinct syntax-highlight colors

---

## 4. Text / ASCII conventions

- **No emoji in output.** Ever. Not in logs, not in exports, not in TUI,
  not in help text. Terminal-native principle.
- **ASCII role prefixes:** `[user]`, `[asst]`, `[tool]`, `[result]`.
  Never `👤` `🤖` `🔧` `📤`.
- **Unicode markers are acceptable** when they carry visual meaning with
  no reasonable ASCII equivalent: `↵` newline visualization,
  `·` space visualization, `→` tab visualization, `║` branch marker,
  `*` annotation marker.
- **Em-dashes** (`—`) over hyphens-pairs (`--`) in prose.

---

## 5. File / IPC contracts (public surfaces between tools)

Anything a sibling depends on is a **public surface.** Breaks require a
release note; silent breaks are bugs.

### agx → public for sift

- **`agx --export json <session>`** — stable JSON schema:
  `{totals, steps, annotations?}`. Schema versioning is agx's
  responsibility. sift treats this as its primary session-parser
  dependency.
- **`agx --jump-to <session>:<step>`** — CLI surface. Accepts either a
  session file path or a session ID; step is a 0-indexed integer.
  Must launch the TUI on the specified step.
- **`agx --version`** — stable machine-parseable format
  (`agx X.Y.Z (<features>)`). Used by sift's `doctor` subcommand.

### rgx → public for sift and agx

- **`rgx -P` / `rgx --output-pattern`** — prints the final pattern to
  stdout on exit; enables `eval $(rgx -P)`.
- **`rgx --pattern <pat> --test <str> --print`** — non-interactive
  match check; stdout receives ANSI-colored matches or empty.
  Exit: 0 match, 1 no match, 2 error.
- **`rgx --version`** — stable machine-parseable format.

### sift → public for nobody

sift is the leaf consumer in the suite. No other tool in the suite reads
sift's output programmatically. If that changes (e.g., agx surfaces sift
ledger status in the timeline detail pane — deliberately deferred), add
the contract to this section before shipping the integration.

---

## 6. Integration rules

Every cross-tool integration must follow these rules. New integrations
that don't fit go through a conventions update before shipping.

1. **Feature-detect at runtime.** `which <sibling>` at startup or on
   first key press that needs it. Never require a sibling at install or
   build time.
2. **Silent degrade.** Missing sibling → status-bar hint pointing at the
   install docs. Never crash, never refuse to launch, never error-exit.
3. **Subprocess boundary.** No linked-library dependencies between the
   three tools. Integration is `spawn + wait` on a documented CLI, or a
   read of a documented file format. No shared Rust crates published
   for integration purposes.
4. **Named integrations.** Every cross-tool flow has a name that appears
   identically in both sides' docs: *Timeline jump*, *Policy debug*,
   *Regex lens*, etc. Names appear in help overlays and READMEs.
5. **One-way coupling.** The consumer knows the producer. The producer
   never knows its consumers. rgx knows about nothing. agx knows about
   nothing in the suite. sift knows about agx and rgx.
6. **Version floor, not ceiling.** Integrations declare "requires agx
   ≥ X.Y" and work with any newer version. Break detection is at
   runtime via `<sibling> --version`.
7. **No reciprocal keybinds.** If sift binds `t` → agx, agx does **not**
   bind a reverse key back to sift. Reciprocity would violate rule 5.

---

## 7. Versioning & compatibility

Each tool ships on its own cadence (semver inside each repo). The suite's
cross-tool compatibility is tracked in a **compatibility table** in each
tool's README, updated on release:

```markdown
## Compatibility

| sift | works with agx | works with rgx |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 0.3.x | 0.4.x+ | 0.11.x+ |
| 0.4.x | 0.5.x+ | 0.11.x+ |
```

When a cross-tool contract breaks:
- The breaking tool's release notes call it out explicitly.
- The consumer tool's next release bumps its version-floor in the table.
- The consumer tool's `doctor` subcommand reports incompatibility and
  suggests the upgrade.

---

## 8. Shared prose & vocabulary

Every README uses these exact phrases where applicable. The repetition is
the point — reads like one team, because it is.

- "Terminal-native."
- "Zero telemetry."
- "No hosted components."
- "Narrow scope, deep engineering."
- "Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0."

Each README's structure follows the same shape:

1. Name + one-line pitch
2. Demo GIF
3. "What it is" paragraph
4. Install block
5. Quick Reference / Keys
6. Architecture summary
7. "Pairs well with" — cross-link to the other two tools
8. License

Not every section must appear, but section order is fixed where sections
do appear.

---

## 9. README cross-links

Every README carries a "Pairs well with" section near the bottom:

```markdown
## Pairs well with

- **[rgx](https://github.com/brevity1swos/rgx)** — terminal regex debugger.
  Used by sift for policy-rule debugging.
- **[agx](https://github.com/brevity1swos/agx)** — terminal agent session
  viewer. Sift's `t` keybind jumps into agx for timeline context.

All three tools are independent — each earns its keep alone. Combined,
they form **stepwise**, the terminal-native step-through debugger stack
for the AI-development workflow.
```

Omit self-reference on each tool's own page. Customize the one-liners to
the reading tool's perspective.

---

## 10. Open retrofit items

Known convention drift, tracked for future alignment. Not urgent; closed
opportunistically when the affected code changes for other reasons.

| Item | Target | Current | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| agx `doctor` | report siblings | not shipped | Retrofit from sift's `doctor` design (shipped v0.3). |
| rgx `doctor` | report siblings | not shipped | Same. |
| agx `--summary` on sift integration | list sift ledger status | no sift awareness | Deferred per rule 5 (one-way coupling). Revisit only if sift validates and users ask. |

**Closed (shipped):**

- sift accept key (`Enter` / `Space`): additive alias shipped v0.3;
  legacy `a`=accept removed in v0.4. Recorded in §1.
- sift annotate key (`a`): flipped from `n` in v0.4. Recorded in §1.
- sift search (`/` + `n` / `N`): added in v0.4. Recorded in §1.

---

## 11. When to update this document

- **Before** adding a new cross-tool integration — it must appear in §1
  (keys), §5 (contracts), and §6 (rules) first.
- **After** breaking a public surface in §5 — add a version note and
  update the compatibility table in each affected README.
- **When** retrofitting a tool to match a convention it currently
  violates — move the item from §10 into the appropriate earlier section
  and record the retrofit date in the tool's CHANGELOG.
- **Never** by diverging the per-repo copies. If a repo needs to deviate,
  amend this doc first and propagate.

---

## 12. Scope boundary

This document covers **shared conventions** across the three tools. It
does **not** cover:

- Per-tool architecture (lives in each repo's CLAUDE.md)
- Per-tool roadmap (lives in each repo's ROADMAP.md)
- Per-tool release process (lives in each repo's CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Cross-tool build / CI (no such system exists; each repo's CI is its own)

When in doubt: if it's about how two tools talk to each other, it's here.
If it's about how one tool is built internally, it's in that tool's
CLAUDE.md.
